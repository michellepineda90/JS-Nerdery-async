# JS-Nerdery-async

The purpose of this repo is to display what I've been working on during Week 2 of
the React JS Nerdery Program.

This week was all about Async JS so you will find two folders in this repo:
An `examples` folder, which contains code along from the courses provided
during the Nerdery, and an `app` folder, which contains a tiny tv search show
app based on the same app in Colt Steele's Wed Developer Udemy course.

The TV Search Show App is deployed in gh-pages and you can fiddle around with
it [here](https://michellepineda90.github.io/JS-Nerdery-async/app/src/).
